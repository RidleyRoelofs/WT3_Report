    "# Work Term 3 Report\n",
    "This report will go over the topics that I researched as part of my Fall 23 NSERC USRA under the supervision of Dr. Nikitas Dimopoulos.\n",
    "\n",
    "I spent the first part of my work term looking into software to simulate quantum circuits and quantum systems. I decided to focus on learning PennyLane, which is a Python library that allows for the development of quantum circuits. These circuits can either be run on a real quantum computer, or simulated. PennyLane offers tutorials and documentation for the library which greatly aided my ability to feel comfortable using the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing has promising applications in being able to simulate quantum systems. Take a quantum system like a molecule. The interactions within the molecule can be reflected within a quantum computer by a series of quantum gates. And there are algorithms that will work on circuits with a low depth and low number of gates. These are called Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some work getting familiar with PennyLane and the problem of approximating ground states of molecules, I wrote up a guide to follow along with my work. It has been replicated below."

    "This exercise was helpful in strengthening my understanding of the theory behind quantum mechanic computations. When working with PennyLane a lot of the hard work was being hidden under easy to use function calls and library features. The code below works through constructing a hamiltonian for the infinite potential well and then uses VQE to solve for the minimum energy eigenstate. Since we can solve for the eigenstates by hand, we then compare the approximate eigenstate to what we would expect.\n",
